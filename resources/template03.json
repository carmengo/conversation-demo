  "title": "A new adsorbent for wastewater treatment",
  "text": "In order to remove very small molecules — which also tend to be electrically charged — with high solubility in water, and to do so selectively, the team had to develop a new adsorbent technology. It developed a fluorine-based nanoporous polymer that has all the desirable properties. By controlling the size of the pores, this adsorbent can selectively adsorb aqueous micromolecules of less than 1–2 nm in size.",
