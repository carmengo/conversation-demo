  "text": "Activated carbon sorbents are important tools in water purification and air-pollution control. This article provides information on the fundamentals of this diverse sorbent and on new applications for which it is being employed. \n Global sustainability trends are creating increased demand for purification of air and water, as well as more environmentally friendly process alternatives. Activated carbon (AC) sorbents play important roles in applications throughout the chemical process industries (CPI).These range from traditional applications, such as municipal water purification and fluegas treatment, to cutting-edge applications, such as adsorbed natural gas storage and double-layer capacitors.\n Activated carbon basics\n\n Activated carbon is a highly porous, high-surface-area adsorptive material with a largely amorphous structure. It is composed primarily of aromatic configurations of carbon atoms joined by random cross-linkages. Activated carbon differs from another form of carbon — graphite — in that activated carbon has sheets or groups of atoms that are stacked unevenly in a disorganized manner. The degree of order varies based on the starting raw material and thermal history. Graphitic platelets in steam-activated coal are somewhat ordered, while more amorphous aromatic structures are found in chemically activated wood.",
